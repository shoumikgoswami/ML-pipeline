![dp_credit](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30216453/123906454-d8758d80-d991-11eb-8dae-6524cf8a7c46.png)

## Objective
This project has been created as a demo to showcase how Datapane can be used to track, infer and share machine learning pipeline updates. The report has been created as an HTML dashboard which can be easily updated and shared across.

## Content
The original dataset contains 1000 entries with 20 categorial/symbolic attributes prepared by Prof. Hofmann. In this dataset, each entry represents a person who takes a credit by a bank. Each person is classified as good or bad credit risks according to the set of attributes.

Age (numeric)
Sex (text: male, female)
Job (numeric: 0 - unskilled and non-resident, 1 - unskilled and resident, 2 - skilled, 3 - highly skilled)
Housing (text: own, rent, or free)
Saving accounts (text - little, moderate, quite rich, rich)
Checking account (numeric, in DM - Deutsch Mark)
Credit amount (numeric, in DM)
Duration (numeric, in month)
Purpose (text: car, furniture/equipment, radio/TV, domestic appliances, repairs, education, business, vacation/others)
